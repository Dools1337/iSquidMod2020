# iSquidMod2020
by Ganders & Imithat (Original author: SAM)
Sick of that stupid griffon on the sides of the main menu bar? Wouldn't you rather have a cool looking octupus, murloc or Diablo 3 art in it's place instead? Well, look no further cause the iSquidMod is here! Type /squid ingame for a full list (for example /squid diablo1_roth)
